SG presidential debate features 'snowman' 

Student Government presidential candidate Josh Hug dressed in a giant foam snowman costume and stole the show at an SG debate Tuesday, as reported by the Daily Texan. 

The bears can't vote candidate told the panel he wasn't making a mockery of SG, right before ripping off his T-shirt and chugging a half-gallon of orange juice on stage.
